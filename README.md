minimumCostSpanningTree
=======================

It's using prim's algorithm in Greedy Methods

One example would be a telecommunications company laying cable to a new neighborhood. 
If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths, then there would be 
a graph representing which points are connected by those paths. Some of those paths might 
be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; 
these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights. A spanning tree for that graph 
would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects to every house. 
There might be several spanning trees possible. A minimum spanning tree would be one with the lowest total cost.
